**Web Application Solution Master Plan**

## Overview:
You're developing a single-page application where users can create events and publish them to multiple backend services. Given the stack and requirements provided, here's a breakdown of tasks to achieve your objectives.

## Task List:

### 1. **Initial Setup**:

1.1. Set up the Next.js project.

1.2. Install dependencies: React, Headless UI, Tailwind CSS, FullCalendar.

1.3. Define global styles with Tailwind.

### 2. **Layout and UI Components**:

2.1. Set up the main layout. This includes a header, content area, and a footer.

2.2. Develop a generic collapsible UI component using Headless UI and Tailwind CSS.

2.3. Develop a generic dropdown component.

2.4. Design the question mark button with a popup. Use the Tooltip or Popover component from Headless UI for the popup explanation.

### 3. **Event Input Fields**:

3.1. Design the primary input fields section.

3.1.1. Create input for Event name.

3.1.2. Input for Event start time.

3.1.3. Input for Event duration.

3.1.4. Radio buttons or dropdown for event type: Online, In-person, or Hybrid.

3.1.5. Conditional rendering for physical location input based on event type.

### 4. **Google Calendar Section**:

4.1. Use the collapsible UI component to create a section for Google Calendar.

4.2. Add a checkbox to toggle this backend's activation.

4.3. Within the section, design the Destination Calendar dropdown with options 'Public' and 'Internal'.

4.4. Incorporate the question mark button with a tooltip explaining the difference between 'Public' and 'Internal' calendars.

4.5. Embed a FullCalendar instance to show events from the two Google Calendars.

### 5. **Zoom Section**:

5.1. Use the collapsible UI component to create a section for Zoom.

5.2. Add a checkbox to toggle this backend's activation.

5.3. Design the Zoom Account dropdown with options 'A', 'B', 'C'.

5.4. Incorporate the question mark button with a tooltip explaining the utility of multiple accounts.

5.5. Embed another FullCalendar instance to show scheduled Zoom meetings from the three accounts.

### 6. **Action Network Section**:

6.1. Use the collapsible UI component to create a section for Action Network.

6.2. Only incorporate the checkbox to toggle this backend's activation.

### 7. **Backend and Integration**:

7.1. Set up API routes in Next.js to communicate with the backend services.

7.2. Integrate with Google Calendar API to fetch and post events.

7.3. Integrate with Zoom API to fetch and schedule meetings.

7.4. Integrate with Action Network (details not provided, but the general idea would be to post the event to Action Network upon activation).

7.5. Add error handling and notifications for successful or failed event postings to each service.

### 8. **Testing and Deployment**:

8.1. Test each section thoroughly ensuring the UI behaves correctly, and backend services are correctly integrated.

8.2. Optimize the application for performance, especially considering API call rates and potential bottlenecks.

8.3. Deploy the Next.js application to a hosting platform of your choice.

### 9. **Documentation and Handover**:

9.1. Write documentation covering how each integration works, and how future developers can expand on the application.

9.2. Ensure code comments are meaningful and consistent.

9.3. Provide a handover to stakeholders or other team members.
